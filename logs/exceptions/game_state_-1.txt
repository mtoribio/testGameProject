# * RELOAD EXCEPTION: ~require~ order might not be valid.
# An uninitialized constant exception was thrown while files were being loaded. Please note
# that DragonRuby's ~require~ method is asynchronous. Which means that a class cannot
# be used within the same file in which it is required.
# 
# If you are using requires, it's recommended that =app/main.rb= only contains require statements
# and that you should create a file called =app/tick.rb= that you ~require~ last.
# 
# Here is a sample structure:
# 
# Let's assume the follow directory hierarchy.
# 
# #+begin_src
# + mygame/
# + app/
# + enemy.rb
# + game.rb
# + main.rb
# + player.rb
# #+end_src
# 
# This is what =app/main.rb= would look like.
# 
# #+begin_src ruby
# #####################
# # main.rb
# #####################
# # 1. app/main.rb should only contain ~require~ statements.
# # 2. The paths should be fully qualified relative your mygame directory.
# # 3. Files should be ordered based on dependencies.
# require 'app/enemy.rb'  # Game relies on Enemy.
# require 'app/player.rb' # Game relies on Player.
# require 'app/game.rb'   # Game definition.
# require 'app/tick.rb'   # =app/tick.rb= which contains the ~tick~ method.
# #+end_src
# 
# This is what =app/tick.rb= would look like.
# 
# #+begin_src ruby
# #####################
# # tick.rb
# #####################
# # Given that =app/tick.rb= is the last ~require~ statement in =app/main.rb=, all classes should
# # be available.
# $game = Game.new(Player.new, Enemy.new)
# 
# def tick args
# $game.tick
# end
# #+end_src
